# Components

These are the core components that make up Clover's base.

## CloverHub

The Rust-based nerve centre for all communication between modules, their components, you, and configuration tools. It is built to be secure and performant, while allowing for flexible implementation for everything from spicing up your cosplay, to surgical body mods.

## CORE

Sensible default applications, lovingly designed parts, and dynamic expression packs to get you started. All parts are built using best-practices, and are considered to be fully supported and used as an immutable fallback when it comes to software.

## Spanner

Advanced configuration application that enables full control and composition of connected modules.
