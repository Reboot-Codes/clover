# Sensors

A sensor component is a bidirectional data component that encompasses everything from temperature, light, and capacitance measurements, to accent LEDs. Sensor components are used for anything that doesn't have a specialized component. For example, you'd use a sensor component for a bend sensor, however, you'd use a [movement component](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/modman/modules/components/movement) for a brushless motor with an encoder. For more complex LED matrices, you'll want to define a [display component](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/modman/modules/components/display) instead to take advantage of the hardware accelerated, centralized, and programmatically efficient [renderer](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/renderer/intro); however, the development libraries have smooth timing functions for things like LED strips when a sensor component is accessed as something like an LED/set of LEDs, or a servo, etc.
