# Physical Modules

A physical piece of hardware who has static functions and statically exposed components. For more complex modules, you'll probably want an [app module](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/modman/modules/app-modules) instead, or you'll have to add a module configuration for each variation of the module to the module directory manually, which can get very unwieldy, very fast.
