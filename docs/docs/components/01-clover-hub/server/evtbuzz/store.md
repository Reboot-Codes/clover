# Store

The store is an in memory state machine managed by EvtBuzz. All configurations and ephemeral states are stored here.

## Ephemeral Data

Ephemeral data in the store is dumped when CloverHub exits by default. IN THE FUTURE, you may supply configuration to keep certain models in persistent storage, or make normally persistent models into ephemeral ones.
