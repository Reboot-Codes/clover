# SpannerLib

SpannerLib is designed to provide a well documented and safe interface for connecting to Clover from an external device (not a [module](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/modman/modules/intro) or [application](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/appd/intro)). It's written in rust and will eventually provide bindings for several languages.
