# Stream Management

Arbiter is uniquely responsible for managing video and audio streams that aren't generated by [the renderer](/docs/components/clover-hub/server/renderer/intro) (despite arbiter handling what can actually be written to displays). This is mostly for internal and external cameras, microphones, and speakers.
