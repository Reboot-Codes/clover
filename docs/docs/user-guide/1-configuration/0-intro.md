# Configuration

Inital configuration is most... er. *ergonomically* done via Ratchet, which can interactively guide a user through planning, BoM creation, first time setup, debugging, etc. If most of that is done, and a user just needs to setup a kit that's pre-configured, Spanner- the mobile client- can be used to complete setup.
