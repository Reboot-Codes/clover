# Prerequisites

Clover is a very complex system, and you'll need to make a few decisions before you can begin to set it up.

[CORE](/docs/components/CORE/intro) is provided to give you a maintainer-supported platform to use and later expand upon; and this guide will focus upon it. Or you can start with your own hardware, and reference this guide as you build and design your own components.

However, in general, you'll need:

<!-- TODO: Create a proper BOM after CORE is designed -->

- An SBC
- Some micro controllers (one per module)
- A couple of motors, servos, LEDs, etc.
- Access to a 3D printer.
- And a computer.
