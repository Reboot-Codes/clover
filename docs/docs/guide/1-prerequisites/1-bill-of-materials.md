# Bill of Materials

- A single board computer
  - Optional, but HIGHLY suggested when using expression recreation: A Tensor Processing Unit (or something that can serve as one, a GPU on the SBC will work, otherwise [refer to Taurus' TPU support](https://taurus.reboot-codes.com/)).
  - Optional, but suggested: Bluetooth Module (as long as the SBC has one and the OS has drivers for it, you'll be fine)
  - Optional, but suggested: WLAN module (same as above, Hub uses the OS's IP stack)
- Body-safe Battery
  -  Reboot/Fitz mainly uses a belt-mounted LiPo battery pack (see: [CORE's modules](/docs/components/CORE/modules/intro)), but you can use just about anything that'll:
     -  Not explode when you go outside in the weather.
     -
